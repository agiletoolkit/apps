	I formed Electroglide after many years of working in a variety of industries and with a wide range of clients.  Electroglide is a Washington DC based consulting and training company specializing in Agile Software Development.  I began using Agile Methods in 1999 and have never looked back.  My work has ranged from being the solo agile developer on a project to working with clients that have over 110 developers on two major projects in 5 development locations.  Regardless of scale my goal is always the same: deliver high quality software using Agile Methods and make the people on the teams happier and more effective.</p>
	
	
	<p>While I have a masters in Electrical Engineering in Computer Architectures for AI, I honestly believe I learned most of my consulting skills growing up in the family restaurant.  After all agile software projects are all about rapid time boxed delivery of value (food), using flexible co-located work teams with an emphasis on customer service.  As the Executive Chef of Electroglide, I will gladly buss a table or wash some dishes if that is the most important thing that needs to be done.</p>
